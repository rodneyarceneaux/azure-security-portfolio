# 🛡️ Azure Security Portfolio  

A hands-on showcase of Azure security architecture, governance, and compliance implementation projects — built and documented by **Rodney Arceneaux**.  

This portfolio demonstrates my expertise in securing enterprise cloud environments, implementing Zero Trust principles, automating compliance enforcement, and aligning technical controls to frameworks such as **CMMC**, **NIST 800-171**, and **HIPAA**.

## 🚀 About This Portfolio
Each project below represents a key area of Azure security engineering — from foundational network design to advanced security automation and compliance mapping.  
All configurations, scripts, and templates are designed for reproducible learning and real-world consulting reference through **RSA Cyber Solutions**.
