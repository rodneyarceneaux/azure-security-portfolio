# üõ°Ô∏è Azure Defender + Microsoft Sentinel Integration

This project extends the **Azure Secure Landing Zone** by integrating **Microsoft Defender for Cloud (XDR)** and **Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)**.  
It establishes a unified detection, investigation, and response environment across your Azure resources ‚Äî enabling visibility into security alerts, network flows, and policy compliance.

---

## üéØ Objective

To design and implement a **detection and response layer** for the Secure Landing Zone using Azure-native tools.

| Capability | Tool | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| Threat Detection | Microsoft Defender for Cloud | Identifies vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and attacks across workloads |
| Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) | Microsoft Sentinel | Centralized log ingestion, analytics, and incident management |
| Network Visibility | NSG Flow Logs + Activity Logs | Enables traffic flow and administrative operation monitoring |

## üß© Architecture Overview

![Sentinel Integration](./docs/sentinel-integration-diagram.png)

> üí¨ **Commentary:**  
> Defender for Cloud provides XDR telemetry from Azure workloads, while Sentinel ingests these events into a centralized Log Analytics workspace.  
> This integration enables automated detection and alert correlation across your **hub-and-spoke landing zone**.

## üß± Implementation Steps

### Step 1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Create or Verify Log Analytics Workspace
```bash
az monitor log-analytics workspace create \
  --resource-group rg-logs \
  --workspace-name law-landingzone \
  --location eastus

**### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Enable Microsoft Sentinel**

Enable Sentinel on your workspace:

az sentinel workspace enable \
  --resource-group rg-logs \
  --workspace-name law-landingzone


Alternatively, in the Azure Portal:

Search Microsoft Sentinel ‚Üí + Add

Select your existing Log Analytics Workspace

Click Add Microsoft Sentinel
Step 3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Connect Azure Activity Logs

Connect subscription-level activity logs to Sentinel for audit and compliance monitoring:

az monitor diagnostic-settings create \
  --name "activitylog-to-law" \
  --resource "/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>" \
  --workspace "/subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/rg-logs/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/law-landingzone" \
  --logs '[{"category": "Administrative", "enabled": true}]'


This ensures all management actions (create/delete/modify resources) are tracked.

Step 4Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Enable NSG Flow Logs (Network Watcher)

In the Azure Portal, search Network Watcher

Navigate to NSG Flow Logs

Select your hub-vnet NSG

Enable Flow Logs

Set destination as your Log Analytics Workspace (law-landingzone)

This provides visibility into allowed/denied traffic flows across your virtual networks.

Step 5Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud Plans

Enable enhanced protection tiers for key services:

az security pricing create --name VirtualMachines --tier 'Standard'
az security pricing create --name AppServices --tier 'Standard'
az security pricing create --name SqlServers --tier 'Standard'


Defender for Cloud ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù tier activates vulnerability scanning, adaptive application controls, file integrity monitoring, and security recommendations.

Step 6Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Connect Microsoft Defender to Sentinel

Go to Microsoft Sentinel ‚Üí Data connectors

Locate Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Click Open connector page ‚Üí Connect

Now, Defender alerts will automatically be sent to Sentinel as incidents.

Step 7Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Create a Custom Analytics Rule

In Sentinel ‚Üí Analytics ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Scheduled query rule

Use the following KQL query to detect failed sign-ins:

SigninLogs
| where ResultType != 0
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, Location


Set trigger:

Condition: count > 5

Period: 5 minutes

Severity: Medium

This helps detect potential brute-force login attempts.

Step 8Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Create a Workbook Dashboard

Go to Sentinel ‚Üí Workbooks ‚Üí + Create new

Add visualizations for:

Defender alerts

Failed sign-ins

NSG flow logs

Save it as Landing Zone Security Overview

This dashboard acts as your visual SOC console.

Step 9Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî (Optional) Deploy a Logic App for Alert Automation

You can automate alert responses (e.g., send email/Teams notifications):

Create a Logic App

Trigger: When a Sentinel incident is created

Action: Send an email or Teams message with incident details

This demonstrates automation (SOAR) integration with Sentinel.
